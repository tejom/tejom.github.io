A recent performance problem on a nodejs app lead me to going into what was actually happening in nodejs. I ended up learning a bunch about how to get insight into nodejs, more specifially v8.

#### Configuring V8:

A node program can take options in two places, before the script name and after. Adding an argument before the script name will pass the argument to the node proccess. Adding an argument after the script name will pass it to the script.
	`node --prof index.js --option`
	This will pass prof to node and v8. "option" will passed to the script.

To get a list of all the V8 options to pass use `node --v8-options`


#### V8 and memory.

V8 is the engine that runs javascript code and handles the memory usage. There's a lot of good information on the web abut Garbage collection and memory in V8 already.

There are two spaces for memory, old space and new space. New
space is made of two parts, to and from. Scavenge garbage collection
happens in the young space and uses Cheneys algorithm. Mark-sweep runs
in old space. Mark-sweep and compacting on old space pause the
javascript vm. When v8 can't allocate any more memory in the young
space all objects are moved to the to space. Then the only objects still in
use are moved back to the from space. Young space will be cleared of
unused objects and compacted. Objects that survive two rounds of
scavenge gc are moved to old space. Large objects can be allocated and
never go to young space.

If you have the V8 source the garbage collection code is in `src/heap/heap.cc`. The function CollectGarbage is a decent starting place to follow along with the code for GC.

Node and V8 have a default memory limit of 1.5gb. There are a few options to configure v8 memory. These options would be passed to node. There are more options too.

```
--min_semi_space_size (min size of a semi-space (in MBytes), the new
space consists of twosemi-spaces)

        type: int  default: 0

  --max_semi_space_size (max size of a semi-space (in MBytes), the new
space consists of twosemi-spaces)

        type: int  default: 0

  --semi_space_growth_factor (factor by which to grow the new space)

        type: int  default: 2

Configure max memory size:

  --max_executable_size (max size of executable memory (in Mbytes))

        type: int  default: 0

```
Node will also trigger a gc when it gets an idle notification. This
can be tweaked through v8 options.

#### Garbage Collection Options:
GC options:

```
--trace_gc

--trace_gc_verbose

--trace_gc_nvp

```

Stolen from the v8 mailing list, an explanation of the gc logs from trace_gc

src/heap/gc-tracer.cc

` [29648:0xbad6f48] 2631 ms: Scavenge 8.0 (22.6) -> 4.2 (22.6) MB, 8.4 / 0 ms [allocation failure]. `



` [<process id>:<isolate address>] <absolute time> ms: <type> <start object size (<start memory size>) -> <end object size> (<end memory size>) MB, <scavenge duration> / <time spent in external callbacks, e.g. embedder> [<reason>].`

Marksweep example:

` [29648:0xbad6f48] 3130 ms: Mark-sweep 8.0 (22.6) -> 4.4 (22.6) MB, 63.0 / 0 ms (+ 69.0 ms in 55 steps since start of marking, biggest step 2.4 ms) [GC interrupt] [GC in old space requested]. `

Same as the scavenge with the extra

` ... (<time spent in incremental marking> / <# incremental steps> , biggest step <longest time for incremental marking step>) [<reason, e.g. GC via stack guard] [<ultimate reason>]. `

#### Optimizations:

V8 uses hidden classes to keep track of the javascript objects
created. Modifying objects after they've been created will create a
new hidden class. This will allocate more memory for what was one
object. As far as v8 is concerned there are 2 now.

When v8 runs code its compiled as quickly as possible. When code is
run repeatedly v8 will track this and eventually optimize the function
called. Frequently run unoptimized code can cause more memory to be
allocated then expected.

```
var a = 1 +2

var b = 3 +4

var c = a +b
```

Normally there would probably be 3 variables allocated. unoptimized
code by v8 will allocate objects for each operation and integer. You
could end up with 12 allocated objects in this example.

Track optimizations with and reasons for deoptimzation. Try catch will
cause code to not be optimized along with a few others.

	--trace-deopt --trace-opt-verbose

#### V8 Tools:

In the v8 repo in the directory `tools` there are some tools to analyze v8 with. Youll need to download the v8 source. There's alot there and doesnt seem to be very documented. Some of these tools need th v8 javascript shell "d8". You can use the evironment variable `D8_PATH` if there are errors about not finding it

Create a v8 timeline with plot-timer-events. This will generate a png
file of the state v8 is in

![image](/assets/timer-events.png)

 - run with options `--prof --noprof-lazy --log-timer-events`

 - Pass the generated log file to the script.

Code kind shows optimized and unoptimized. Green is optimized and blue and red are unoptimized.

Another tools is \<os>-tick-proccesor

Functions seen by profiler 

"*" shows optimized  and "~" unoptimized

--prof --noprof-lazy --log-timer-events

ex:

./tools/linux-tick-processor --range=162000,195000 ./isolate-0x30a5380-v8.log

#### IC - Inline Cache

There is a tool in v8 to look at ic. I dont know how to make sense of
it. But its there.

ic-explorer.html in tools.

#### Debugging

Compile node to debug with gdb:

clone the node repo.

```
./configure --debug

make
```

There is probably a way to compile node to show javascript that is on
the stack. I haven't gotten it to work. Its common to hear that node is single threaded. It's true that the javascript is single threaded. v8 is actually multithreaded so check the other thread stacks gdb.

Chrome developer tools can also be used. Newer versions of node
have this built in. Your probabaly better off just using that. If not, node-inspector and node-debug can be used to debug. It works by fowaridng a port.

Node-debug doesn't bind to all address by default. You'll need to do something
like this if your on another machine. Then open the given link the browser.
replace localhost with the ip.

	node-debug [node/v8 options] --web-host=0.0.0.0

Chrome tools lets you profile the cpu, take heap snap shots.

Add '--inspect --debug-brk' to the node command. Forward the port to
your machine 'ssh -L 9229:127.0.0.1:9229 <user>@<testing vm> -N' and
open the link in chrome

Flamegraph profiling:

Theres a lot of tools to do this. I thought perf is pretty cool.

#### Extra Reading and sources:

Extra reading on v8 and javascript vms. I found it helpful to think of
node less of a node application and more of v8 application.
